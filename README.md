# SafeCircularBuffer
1. What is a Circular Buffer?
A circular buffer (also called a ring buffer) is a fixed-size data structure that stores elements in a way that “wraps around” when it reaches its capacity. Imagine a fixed-length array where, after adding elements to the end, you start overwriting the oldest elements at the beginning. It’s like a conveyor belt: new items are added at one end, and old items are removed or overwritten at the other.
Key Features of a Circular Buffer
•  Fixed Size: The buffer has a set capacity that doesn’t change.
•  Efficient: Uses a single array and reuses space, avoiding the need to resize.
•  FIFO (First-In, First-Out): Elements are read in the order they were added.
•  Overwrites Old Data: When full, adding a new element overwrites the oldest one.
The SafeCircularBuffer in this manual is an actor-based implementation, meaning it’s safe to use in concurrent applications (e.g., with multiple threads or tasks) without risking data corruption.

2. Benefits of Using a Circular Buffer
Circular buffers are useful in many scenarios, especially in performance-sensitive or resource-constrained applications. Here are the key benefits:
1.  Memory Efficiency:
	•  A circular buffer uses a fixed amount of memory, unlike arrays that grow dynamically. This is ideal for applications where memory is limited, such as embedded systems or real-time apps.
2.  Constant-Time Operations:
	•  Adding (pushing) and removing (popping) elements are fast (O(1) time complexity), making it suitable for high-performance tasks like streaming data or buffering audio.
3.  Automatic Overwrite:
	•  When the buffer is full, new elements automatically overwrite the oldest ones. This is perfect for scenarios where you only need the most recent data, like logging recent user actions or storing sensor readings.
4.  Thread Safety (with SafeCircularBuffer):
	•  The SafeCircularBuffer uses Swift’s actor model to ensure that multiple tasks can access the buffer simultaneously without causing data races or crashes. This is crucial in modern apps with concurrent operations, like networking or UI updates.
5.  Simplicity:
	•  The API is straightforward, with methods like push, pop, and peek, making it easy to integrate into your app, even for beginners.
Common Use Cases
•  Real-Time Data Processing: Buffering audio or video streams.
•  Logging: Storing the most recent log messages or events.
•  Producer-Consumer Systems: Handling data produced by one task and consumed by another (e.g., network packets).
•  Undo/Redo Features: Storing a fixed number of recent user actions.

3. Getting Started with SafeCircularBuffer
Prerequisites
•  Swift Version: Swift 6 or later (this code uses strict concurrency features).
•  Environment: Xcode 17 or later, or another Swift-compatible IDE.
•  Knowledge: Basic Swift syntax (structs, actors, async/await) and familiarity with generics.
Installation
The SafeCircularBuffer code is provided as a standalone Swift module. To use it:
1.  Create a new Swift file (e.g., SafeCircularBuffer.swift) in your project.
2.  Copy and paste the code from the revised implementation below (or the one provided earlier).
3.  Ensure your project targets Swift 6 with strict concurrency checking enabled.
